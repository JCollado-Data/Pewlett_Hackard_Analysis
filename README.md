##Purpose
As time progresses it is important as a company to keep in mind our employees and where they are in life and their careers. As we examine the data of our employees we can see who is coming close to retirement to ensure we are ready for their departure. We can also look at others and identiy those who could surve as mentors for newer employees. 

##Results
- There are 25,916 Senior Engineers and 24,926 Senior Staff reaching retirement age
- There are 1550 mentor eligabble people
- 72,458 people will be entering retirerment age
- There are a total of 300,024 at the company which means about 24% are entering retirment age

#Summary
After looking into the data it we can see that there are 72,458 people are entering retirement age. We can see that the "Silver Tsunami" might pose a potential problem to the company. With almost 24% of the company work force entering retirment age, we can predict that this could pose a possible issue for the company. There would be massive spots opening in the company at the senior level that would need to be replaced.
